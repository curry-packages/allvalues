======================================================================

* `Chords.curry`:
  this program is able to generate appropriate chords for the accompaniment
  of a given melody. There is also a
  [a paper](http://www.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~mh/reports/LIFO-98-08.html)
  which sketches the implementation and describes
  the advantages of Curry to implement this application.
* `England.curry`:
  a geographical database and some queries from the Escher report
* `SportsDB.curry`:
